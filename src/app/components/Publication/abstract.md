**Title:** Improving the Experience of Listening Broadcast Programs Using Social Media Data

---

**1. Introduction**
Radio broadcasting remains a key medium for delivering news, culture, and entertainment, yet its linear nature poses challenges for modern listeners who seek flexible, personalized experiences. In this work, we explore how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and social media signals can be leveraged to enhance the listening experience by identifying and summarizing important broadcast segments. Specifically, we analyze Twitter posts related to radio programs to capture moments of high audience engagement and develop methods to generate highlights that support more efficient listening.

**2. Research Motivation**
Listeners often face difficulties in revisiting long broadcast archives. Conventional indexing by time or program title does not reflect the audienceâ€™s perception of what was interesting or impactful. Social media, especially Twitter, provides a rich, real-time stream of audience reactions. By integrating NLP-based tweet analysis with broadcast content, we aim to improve accessibility and personalization in radio listening.

**3. Methodology**
Our approach consists of three key steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Tweets related to selected radio programs were gathered using program-specific hashtags and keywords.
2. **Analysis:** We measured tweet frequency and semantic similarity across broadcast segments to detect highlights.
3. **Summarization:** The identified segments were aligned with audio content and presented as shortened, highlight-based listening experiences.

**4. Experiment and Evaluation**
We conducted a user study with participants who listened to broadcasts using either our highlight-based method or conventional full-length playback. Participants evaluated their experiences based on efficiency, satisfaction, and perceived informativeness. Results indicate that the proposed method allowed users to consume content more quickly without significantly reducing comprehension, while also increasing satisfaction when seeking key program moments.

**5. Discussion**
Although our dataset was limited in scale, the study demonstrates the potential of integrating social media signals into broadcast summarization. By using audience engagement as a proxy for importance, the system supports both casual and time-constrained listeners. Future directions include scaling up with larger datasets (e.g., international programs, multilingual corpora) and combining multimodal signals such as speech transcripts, audio features, and cross-platform reactions.

**6. Conclusion**
This research provides an initial step toward enhancing the radio broadcast experience through NLP and social media analysis. Despite being based on small-scale data, the findings reveal promising directions for bridging media consumption with audience-driven insights. Expanding this work in larger contexts will contribute to recommender systems, personalized media services, and computational social science.
